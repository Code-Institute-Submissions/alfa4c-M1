### User Stories ###
   As an Alfa Romeo fan and a **user** I would like:
   * I **want** to **navigate** quickly and easily.
   * I **want** to see **colours** that the car can be configured with.
   * I **want** to know what type of **chassis** does the car have.
   * I **want** facts and relative details.
   * I **want** a **video/review** about the car.
   * I may **need** to **contact** to ask for help on the car.

### Design Thoughts
---
When thinking about the **design** choices for this website I decided that going for the **Alfa Romeo** hex colours would be a good idea so it would be famillar to an Alfa Romeo fan but I decided to go with a different type of **font** to Alfa to make it **unique** but also famillar. I intend on giving the website an Alfa Romeo feel.
