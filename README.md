### Design Thoughts
---
When thinking about the **design** choices for this website I decided that going for the **Alfa Romeo** hex colours would be a good idea so it would be famillar to an Alfa Romeo fan but I decided to go with a different type of **font** to Alfa to make it **unique** but also famillar I picked this through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for my font choices see [here](#website-font-choices) . I intend on giving the website an Alfa Romeo feel.

#### Alfa Romeo Hex Colours:
* I plan on using **#C22636** for icons, SVGS, borders.
* I plan on using **#3a3a4a** for the text this will be easy to see against a white background.
* I plan on using **#FFFFFF** for the background this will make the **#C22636** stand out and make **#3a3a4a** easy to read.
* I plan on using **1B2441** for the footer background to give some more Alfa Romeo feel with **#FFFFFF** to stand out.

#### Website Font Choices
The font's that I picked are becazuse I feel like they have a modern and sleeck feel and will look right with the colours I have picked with the website. When implementing these font's I may find that they aren't what I want and could be subject to change. For boyd text and links I have picked [Dosis](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dosis) and for headings I chose [Barlow Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Condensed)
