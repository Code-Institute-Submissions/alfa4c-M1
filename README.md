### Design Thoughts
---
When thinking about the **design** choices for this website I decided that going for the **Alfa Romeo** hex colours would be a good idea so it would be famillar to an Alfa Romeo fan but I decided to go with a different type of **font** to Alfa to make it **unique** but also famillar. I intend on giving the website an Alfa Romeo feel.
