## **User Experience (UX)**
### Project Goals
---
 * To create a website that gives insight into why the Alfa Romeo 4C will be a future classic and the history behind why it was built.
 * Clean easy navigation.
 * 4 pages of Contents.
 * Responsive on all devices.
 * Lightweight but good quality images maybe use webp for speed.
### Website Owner Goals
---
 * To **show** and display responsive and well organised and commented code.
 * Demonstrate Bootstrap skills.
 * Demonstrate native CSS skills.
 * To **communicate** to users about the story of the 4C and why it is different from modern day sports cars.

### User Goals
---
 * **Research** and **find information** about facts and colours the car can be configured with.
 * **find** a video which can be used to give an entertaining honest review on the car.
 * **find** copyright free images and make sure they're of the right size page speed isn't effected and also credit the photographer within the project.
 * **Contact** site owner by submitting a form with input fields to capture contact reason we have to put validation on the fields to stop spam.
### User Stories ###
---
   As an Alfa Romeo fan and a **user** I would like:
   * I **want** to **navigate** quickly and easily.
   * I **want** to see **colours** that the car can be configured with.
   * I **want** to know what type of **chassis** does the car have.
   * I **want** facts and relative details.
   * I **want** a **video/review** about the car.
   * I may **need** to **contact** to ask for help on the car.
### Design Thoughts
---
When thinking about the **design** choices for this website I decided that going for the **Alfa Romeo** hex colours would be a good idea so it would be familiar to an Alfa Romeo fan but I decided to go with a different type of **font** to Alfa to make it **unique** but also familiar I picked this through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for my font choices see [here](#website-font-choices) . I intend on giving the website an Alfa Romeo feel.

#### Alfa Romeo Hex Colours:
* I plan on using **#C22636** for icons, SVGS, borders.
* I plan on using **#3a3a4a** for the text this will be easy to see against a white background.
* I plan on using **#FFFFFF** for the background this will make the **#C22636** stand out and make **#3a3a4a** easy to read.
* I plan on using **1B2441** for the footer background to give some more Alfa Romeo feel with **#FFFFFF** to stand out.

#### Website Font Choices
The font's that I picked are because I feel like they have a modern and sleek feel and will look right with the colours I have picked with the website. When implementing these font's I may find that they aren't what I want and could be subject to change. For bold text and links I have picked [Dosis](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dosis) and for headings I chose [Barlow Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Condensed)

### Dependencies, languages and resources
---
So far whilst coding my project the [Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) have been essential to finding out the classes for changing margin, applying flex containers, mobile classes to show elements based upon screen width for implementing the navbar dropdown I recommend when using Bootstrap to search through there docs as there will most likely already be a class already defined in there somewhere.

I have also referred to [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and other forums for making the parallax section on the home page these are resources that come in handy no matter how skilled of a developer if there's something you're stuck on it helps to ask.

Additionally I have also used Slack to help with my project as I encountered a problem with the license expiring for [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) which meant I couldn't edit my wireframes for my project but thanks to Slack I managed to resolve it.

For writing some of the content I have used my own thoughts and opinions around the car however for some facts and more statistical numbers I have used the [Alfa 4C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfa_Romeo_4C).

#### Dependencies
* Google Fonts (Chosen Fonts from here)
* Bootstrap (Quick and easy to use framework which helps create a responsive website)

#### Languages/Softwares
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* JQuery
* Popper
* Git
#### Resources
* Balsamiq Wireframes
* Canva
* Unsplash (For uncopyrighted imagery)
* W3 Schools
* Slack
### Wireframes
---
I decided to use [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) as the wireframing tool for my project this is because of the simplistic but easy to use software allows for wireframing projects quickly and easily. It offers a selection of icons which are great for demonstrating how the project woTestinguld look on smaller screens. There are other software out there which can be used for Wireframing such as Adobe XD, Wireframe.cc and more. I decided to use Balsamiq on this project.

I should note as these are just wireframes that the final project may look different.  I have created a wireframe for each page Home, About, Contact and Gallery with a wireframe for each device Desktop, Mobile and Tablet.

To see all my wireframes they are [here.](/wireframes/)

Here is the Home page wireframe:

### Testing
---
I have only doing a small amount of testing so far but I have used Chrome Dev Tools a-lot by using the elements tab and mobile button to see how the header has interacted with mobile. I have opted to have two headers one that shows on Desktop and one which will show on mobile.

Chrome Dev tools allowed me to create developments first to try and eradicate and bugs when code was deployed and pushed to my project. Chrome Dev tools isn't the only thing I have used to make sure my project is well organised and put together well. I use a IDE Code editor called Atom and with some packages installed such as beautify this code editor allows code to be written simply but also organised and formatted in a easy to read and professional way.

### Bug fixing
There are always bugs which you try to account for but may require deployment to a local development in order for you to see in practice how your code works I used a local preview and chrome Dev Tools to check on different screen sizes, console errors and to see if CSS was
* Wrong Bootstrap styles applied for Mobile and Desktop navigation bars meant navbars was showing on wrong screen sizes
