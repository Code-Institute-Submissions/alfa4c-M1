### Design Thoughts
---
When thinking about the **design** choices for this website I decided that going for the **Alfa Romeo** hex colours would be a good idea so it would be famillar to an Alfa Romeo fan but I decided to go with a different type of **font** to Alfa to make it **unique** but also famillar I picked this through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for my font choices see [here](#website-font-choices) . I intend on giving the website an Alfa Romeo feel.

#### Alfa Romeo Hex Colours:
* I plan on using **#C22636** for icons, SVGS, borders.
* I plan on using **#3a3a4a** for the text this will be easy to see against a white background.
* I plan on using **#FFFFFF** for the background this will make the **#C22636** stand out and make **#3a3a4a** easy to read.
* I plan on using **1B2441** for the footer background to give some more Alfa Romeo feel with **#FFFFFF** to stand out.

#### Website Font Choices
The font's that I picked are because I feel like they have a modern and sleeck feel and will look right with the colours I have picked with the website. When implementing these font's I may find that they aren't what I want and could be subject to change. For boyd text and links I have picked [Dosis](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dosis) and for headings I chose [Barlow Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Condensed)

### Wireframes
---
I decided to use [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) as the wireframing tool for my project this is because of the simplistic but easy to use software allows for wireframing projects quickly and easily. It offers a selection of icons which are great for demonstrating how the project would look on smaller screens. There are other software out there which can be used for Wireframing such as Adobe XD, Wireframe.cc and more. I decided to use Balsamiq on this project.

I should note as these are just wireframes that the final project may look different.  I have created a wireframe for each page Home, About, Contact and Gallery with a wireframe for each device Desktop, Mobile and Tablet.

To see all my wireframes they are [here.](/wireframes/)

Here is the Home page wireframe:

### Testing
---
I have only doing a small amount of testing so far but I have used Chrome Dev Tools alot by using the elements tab and mobile button to see how the header has interacted with mobile. I have opted to have two headers one that shows on Desktop and one which will show on mobile.
